## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puzz-tech/gems
   ```

2. Open it up in [VSCode]

   ```bash
   code gems
   ```

3. VSCode should prompt you to reopen the repo in a [DevContainer].  If not, you can open the command palette and search
   for `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
   > This repo uses [DevContainer]s to enable getting setup with all the development dependencies quickly and easily.
   > Using a DevContainer requires that you have VSCode and Docker installed but it should minimize the getting started
   > friction after that initial setup. Follow the [DevContainers Getting Started] instructions to get the basics setup.
